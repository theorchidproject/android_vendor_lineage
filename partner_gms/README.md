## REMOVED FDROID STUFF AND ADDED AURORA INSTEAD


The included APKs are:
   * Aurora Store and Services (https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS). Pre-signed prebuilts by dev (from gitlab always).
   * microG packages (binaries sourced from [here](https://microg.org/download.html))
   * GmsCore: the main component of microG, a FOSS reimplementation of the Google Play Services (requires GsfProxy and FakeStore for full functionality)
   * GsfProxy: a GmsCore proxy for legacy GCM compatibility
   * FakeStore: an empty package that mocks the existence of the Google Play Store
   * IchnaeaNlpBackend: Network location provider using Mozilla Location Service
   * NominatimGeocoderBackend: Geocoder backend that uses OSM Nominatim service
   * Googlesync, contacts and backup apks
These are official unmodified prebuilt binaries, signed by the
corresponding developers.
